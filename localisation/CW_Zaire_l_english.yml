 zaire.1.t:0 "Death of Patrice Lumumba"
 zaire.1.d:0 "Former Congolese Prime Minister and Pan-African advocate Patrice Lumumba has been found dead in his home of natural causes. Lumumba was 85.\nPatrice Lumumba was elected the first prime minister of the newly independent Democratic Republic of the Congo and was leader of the Congolese National Movement from 1958 up until his retirement in 1983. Lumumba has remained a controversial figure in Congolese politics, as his internal policies have widely been seen to bring Congo out of being a colony and borderline failed state- however the consequences of his foreign policy had been much more dire. Following a refusal of the United States and Belgium to help Lumumba put down a Katangan separatist revolt, he turned to the Soviet Union, who was much more willing to provide aid, especially in the face of American apathy. Following this shift from neutrality to a Soviet friendly foreign policy, tensions arose between Lumumba and his fervently anti-Soviet Chief Of Staff, Mobutu Sese Seko. Mobutu, paranoid about the growing Soviet influence over the DRC as well as the increasing socialist tendencies of pan-Africanists like Lumumba, Mobutu launched a successful military coup and installed himself as dictator. Lumumba however was able to flee to the neighboring Congo-Kinshasa and became a symbol of resistance for those tired of Mobutu’s despotic reign. In 1991, The DRC (which to this day has been renamed Zaire) was wracked with economic malaise and unemployment, despite continued radio and television broadcasts portraying Mobutu and his cabinet as god-like figures with immense riches. Using the exiled Lumumba as a rallying figure, pro-Democratic forces overthrew and murdered the dictator, establishing a provisional government and promising elections the next year. Lumumba was invited back from exile to help formulate the new constitution for Zaire which would ensure civil liberties would be protected in the face of the violent Mobutu regime.\n\nWith authoritarian nationalism rising in Africa as an angered response to the proxy state politics of the 60 year long Cold War, many international observers fear that with the passing of one of the most prominent advocates and symbols of African democracy in the country that authoritarianism may take hold of the impoverished country once more."
