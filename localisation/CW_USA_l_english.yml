 usa.1.t:0 "Release of Toy Story 3"
 usa.1.d:0 "After being in production hell from since the beginning of production from 2006, Toy Story 3 has finally released to an astonishing box office performance. Written by screenwriter Jim Herzfeld, the plot follows Woody and the gang as they travel to Taiwan in pursuit of their friend Buzz Lightyear who had been recalled because of Buzz Lightyear action figures have been malfunctioning worldwide, meanwhile Buzz meets other Buzz Lightyears along with other toys such as Lotso the Bear, who were once loved toys but have since been recalled. Despite it’s four year development hell, the film has had a heavy marketing push by Disney since the first trailer dropped early last year and appears to be paying off. In the first weeks of its release, it has already become the highest grossing animated movie of all time, making over $1 billion worldwide and surpassing Shrek 2 as the highest grossing animated movie of all time. The movie has also been a smash hit with critics with review sites like Rotten Tomato giving it a ‘Fresh’ rating on it’s site and publications such as Time Magazines naming Toy Story 3 ‘the best film of the year’. Toy Story 3 is yet another notch to add to Disney Pixar’s belt as this is yet another hit made by the studio. However, the film is subject to a conspiracy theory that it is anti-Chinese propaganda and as such as been banned from being screened in China."

 usa.2.t:0 "Ask The Lord - Pete Seeger"
 usa.2.d:0 "'Dear ol'Billy ask the Lord, ask the Lord for forgiveness for what you did too the poor children of Egypt' was just one of many memorable quotes from new song released by Leftist Christian folk singer Pete Seeger. Ask The Lord has very noticeable anti-imperialist, anti-racist, and anti-neoliberal ideas as Pete Seeger attacked the 3 last US presidents for many of their policies and/or ideas, such as Bill Clinton's intervention in Egypt, Pat Buchanan's very blatant racism and occasional use of racial slurs, as well as current President, Mark Roosevelt and his refusal to work with the New Democracy Caucus within the Democratic Party to not 'alienate' moderates and his claims that his great-grandfather, Theodore Roosevelt would support his actions too not alienate moderates. Seeger went as far as to say that Theodore Roosevelt would be disappointed in his great-grandson for his fear. The whole song culminates in an attack on the 3 presidents while calling them cowards and the constant suggestion for them to ask God for forgiveness before its too late.\n\nThe song has become very popular among Christian leftist circles and even non-Christian leftist circles from Muslims to Atheists, Pete Seeger has released quite famous left leaning songs in the past but this has blown up beyond belief too the point that some libertarian and conservative online personalities have criticized the song as an attempt to radicalize Christian youth. Phil Ochs, another famous leftist folk singer even performed the song on stage with recent musical partner Neil Young while performing at Cesar Chavez Plaza in Sacramento raising money for 'Food Not Bombs' an activist and charitable organization with left wing sympathies."

 usa.3.t:0 "Batman 4: would you like justice with that?"
 usa.3.d:0 "The ill fated "Batman 4: would you like justice with that?" Hit the box office last weekend with its premier at London's leicester square even receiving boos from the journalist audience. A unknown event in the movie industry. Phone recordings smuggled out of the cinema even show lead actor Johnny Depp storming out the viewing in a rage supposably mumbling about how will his career recover.\n\nBatman 4: would you like justice with that? Is the 4th adventure in the Sony Baz Luhrmann DC universe. In this car crash of a cinematic experience the Cape crusader goes after the the The Condiment King, played by Wil Wheaton who's Condiment guns are capable of causing anaphylactic shock. The villan, who is normally used as comedic effect in the comics did not transition well to the big screen and fans let Sony know buy avoiding screenings of the film.\n\nThough social media has trashed the film hardcore Baz Luhrmann DC universe fans known as "Bazties" have been quick to point out that a lot of the movies issues, such as the impromptu rhyming musical security truck robbery and bizzare mountain dew product placement during Robin's funeral have been forced in by Sony and where not in the original Baz Luhrmann script which showed The Condiment King as a down and out father of 3 on the poverty line who tries to pay for his children's medical bills by turning his hot dog stall into a criminal racket, highlighting the societal issues of poverty within the world today. Sony have been awfully quiet on this shipwreck but it seems that internal company emails leaked to the press suggest that the company will now pull the plug on the expected 5th movie in the franchise."
