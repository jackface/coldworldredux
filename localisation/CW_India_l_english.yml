 POLITICS_INDIRA_GANDHI_DESC:0 "Daughter of the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi is often called ‘Mother Indira’ and ‘Indira the Unkillable’ by her loyal supporters but is also known as ‘The Empress of India’ and ‘Indira Bonaparte’ by her opponents. In truth, Indira did indeed deserve these titles at one point due to her successful handling of Operation Bluestar where she ruthlessly crackdown on Sihk radicals as well as surviving an assassination attempt by her bodyguards. However, Indira is not the ‘Iron Lady of India’ anymore, in fact she is now less like Napoleon and more like Charles the Mad, with the INC being under the control of her son, Rajiv, while Indira suffers from dementia in private yet her son’s aids are able to look nice enough as not to arouse suspicion. Fortunately, India is booming and is on the fast track at being a global superpower and the Gandhi family’s grip on power is secure so long as Indira is a figurehead. With the best doctors on the Indian subcontinent, it’s a near impossibility for Indira to die soon, right?"
