 ENG_lasting_traditionalism:0 "Lasting Traditionalism"
 ENG_lasting_traditionalism_desc:0 "The Thatcherite Era as it has come to be known has left a traditionalist grip over the nation, not much progressive if any is passed through the parliament and the Tories have managed to promote Christian values."
 
 ENG_unions_in_shreds:0 "Unions In Shreds"
 ENG_unions_in_shreds_desc:0 "Besides conservative social values, one thing that Maggie Thatcher and her successors have been known for is breaking the unions, while not illegal, unions are heavily suppressed by the government and heavily discouraged. With the collapse of the unions, most workers go unrepresented and 31 years without a Labour government has caused many problems for the workers."
 
 ENG_the_troubles:0 "The Troubles"
 ENG_the_troubles_desc:0 "For decades Northern Ireland has been a war zone between the IRA, Unionist paramilitaries, and the British army, the Thatcherites have been known to do nothing but increase military presence and crack down on any form of nationalist sympathy within Northern Ireland. It is likely the issue of The Troubles will not be fixed under any form of Thatcherite government."
 
 ENG_a_dead_tradition:0 "A Dead Tradition"
 ENG_a_dead_tradition_desc:0 "It was once believed the conservative traditions of the Thatcherite era were a staple of the country, however the recent break out of riots has shown that there may be more to the facade then meets the eye."

 ENG_republican_sympathies_desc:0 "The Republican movement was not a very strong one at the turn of the century, but with the Queen's endorsement of the Thatcherite government and refusal to dissolve parliament at the will of the people, she has proven the insitution of the monarchy an enemy of the people and Britain."

 britain.1.t:0 "The Death of The Iron Lady"
 britain.1.d:0 "No one expected that this day would come, but like all things in life, everything eventually must come to an end, today at 10:45pm the B.B.C stopped the regular programing to announce that former PM: Margaret Hilda Thatcher had died from a fatal heart attack after a visit to the British Museum. The reactions at first to this announcement where the expected: many messages of condolence where sent to the PMs office and many politicians and the Queen gave the expected messages in the telly, talking about Mrs. Thatcher life and how much shall the United Kingdom miss her.  But all these messages of sympathy and about the greatness of Mrs. Thatcher administration seem to have awoken a silent majority of our citizens who decided to show their true feelings about the Thatcher era. At the morning of the following day, the T.U.C of the UK called for a general strike to protest against PM Mark Thatcher unpopular anti-union policies using slogans such as: The witch is dead now it’s the turn of the king; no one shall mourn her and, let’s bring the guillotine to end deaths work. The strike got the sympathies of many of the people, especially those that had been affected by the decisions of the administrations of both Thatcher’s during their time as head of government This was no longer a simple workers strike, it was a full blown riot: students, falklands war veterans, doctors, workers, poor people where all finally showing their anger. The cut of social services, the union busting, the harsh handling of the troubles and the excessive involvement in foreign affairs all the anger that the people had contained after all those events was finally coming out. It was the revenge of the people. Many of them were wondering: ¿Why hasn’t the PM come out?, ¿Why hasn’t he said anything to end with this mess?, The answer might be harder and even sadder that anything that the people could come up with, PM Mark Thatcher had been, since his mother’s death was announced, locked in his office looking at some old pictures and reminiscing about all the good times that he had with his mother, and thinking in silence what was he going to do now. His protector, friend and guide was gone, he didn’t know what do now, there was only one question remaining in his head: ¿what do I do now?"

 britain.2.t:0 "Crisis At The Service"
 britain.2.d:0 "Even through many rumors seemed to indicate that Mrs. Thatcher's funeral would be suspended because of the protests at the end, even with all the chaos and danger, 10 days after Mrs. Thatcher death, her official state funeral was held. At first the funeral looked liked any other funeral in British history, the only difference that could be noticed was an slight increase in security, all it looked like everything was going to stay calm in the funeral, even a little smile was noticed in the PMs face when the queen started to talk about Mrs. Thatcher achievements, but suddenly a loud noise was heard and then another one, MI5 and the Royal Guard quickly went into action to protect all the high ranking officials, some hours after evacuating everyone in the funeral, MI5 started an official investigation into the shoots, they quickly found the shooter and neutralized him. When checking his body, they found an small pin with the Scottish flag that said: Freedom!!!, and a bag with posters that had William Wallace’s face and also some keys that they quickly found out opened a van that was parked in Sega’s World parking lot. The contents of the van where worrying. They where several guns and knives, more Scottish independence propaganda and a big Scottish flag, but the most worrying objects where a pipe bomb, and a plan called Operation Braveheart, it’s objective to kill all members of the government and the queen. Even with the shooter caught and the attempt stopped, one last tragedy was going to happen in the U.K that day. After the shoots, Foreign Secretary Braiser began to feel unwell, so she was taken to the hospital, where it was found that a bullet, that was supposed to hit PM Mark Thatcher, had hit her, the doctors tried to save her but they failed. That day at 9pm, Foreign Secretary Theresa Brassier had died."

 britain.10.t:0 "The Stray Bullet"
 britain.10.d:0 "A tragic incident happened today at a massive pro-republican rally at Leeds today.  The rally was spurred on by the occupation of police stations in Yorkshire and Wales, and was headed by socialist Jeremy Corbyn and CPB leader Bob Crow.  The organizers of the rally planned a large gathering at the town hall to show solidarity to the anti-police actions and to use the momentum generated by the occupations to push for republicanism.  Speakers for the rally included various socialist figures such as Tariq Ali, Owen Jones, and George Galloway and as well as left-leaning authors and celebrities such as Iain Banks.  It was covered favorably by various left-wing homegrown media such as Novara Media, as well as by both Chinese and Soviet state news outlets.  Conversely, the American and British media either downplayed the rally or criticized its aims.\n\nThe heated gathering erupted into violence not long after it’s commencement, when a large battalion of police officers descended on the crowd with the intention of “restoring order”; through many republicans would believe that the police sought revenge for the occupations launched by republican activists.  Many of the police officers bought horses and riot gear.  Clashes between the police and the republicans erupted not long after their arrival, and in the midst of the clashes a stray shot was fired by police officer Alfie Moore.  The incident was first reported by Tom Walker of Novara Media, whom claimed that one of the leaders of the rally has been shot by the stray bullet.  As the dust cleared, there were massive arrests and injuries, and the British media reported that the dead body of one of the organizers has been found lying in a pool of blood, having died from a gunshot wound."

 britain.12.t:0 "The Army In London"
 britain.12.d:0 "Following the occupation of police stations in Yorkshire and Wales, as well as the collapse of parliament, government control over Britain has remained relatively non-existent. Many Conservative politicians and public figures have railed against Prime Minister Thatcher for her inaction on the occupations, with various tabloids dubbing her The Wobbling Lady, as both an insult for her being a pushover for the “radical left” that said tabloids warn about as well as a dig at her for not upholding the values of her mother.\n\nSick and tired of the constant pressure to take action despite parliament being dissolved as well as the large presence of Conservatives Elected on a “law and order” platform, Thatcher has taken the advice of this newly formed “law and order coalition”, led by Iain Duncan Smith to take drastic measures. The British Army has set up camp in previously civilian areas of London and established a curfew, making it abundantly clear to the British population that, as she confirmed in a speech hours after the mobilization that Thatcher has declared martial law over the United Kingdom.\n\nThe backlash from opposition MPs, most of the citizenry, as well as Conservatives outside of this law and order coalition has been immense, decrying the declaration as a fascist takeover. Dennis Skinner, a Labour MP already well known for his controversial outbursts in parliament, was especially vocal in his criticisms of the Thatcher cabinet, calling her a 'crazy despotic bitch', and demanding that 'Cuntface Carol' reverse this decision, adhere to the calls for a general election, and resign as she has, in his eyes, betrayed the British people 'in such a gross fashion not seen since James I.'"

 britain.13.t:0 "Max Mosley Calls For Republican Plebiscite"
 britain.13.d:0 "Amidst the chaos between pro-Thatcher and anti-Thatcher Forces, the voice for cooperation has come from an incredibly unlikely source. Max Mosley, son of the infamous British Fascist Oswald Mosley, and leader of the successor party to his British Union of Fascists, has proposed a referendum on the issue of republicanism vs Monarchism that has recently garnered the country’s eyes and ears.\n\nMosley’s position has remained inconsistent throughout the years, flip flopping on the issue many times in interviews- in the face of this national controversy, Mosley has interestingly chosen a fence-sitting path, stating that he’s not entirely for a republic yet not entirely against it. Whereas Corbyn and Crow have recently demanded the Queen capitulate and give the British people the republican government they claim they desire, Mosley has proposed that the government organize a referendum on the issue of Republic, stating 'if the British people truly want a republic as the left claims, or want a monarchy as a right claims, why don’t we just ask them instead of throwing a temper tantrum?'\nWhile some media outlets have been quick to praise Mosley as a voice of common sense and bipartisanship desperately needed in such a divided nation, many left-Wing commentators have a more cynical take on his motivations, claiming that he’s just grandstanding to stand out among the crowd. Mosley has made it very clear his position on the current left-Wing protestors, saying he agrees with their actions but not their politics. Left-wingers have pointed to this fact along with the fact that the supposed voice of moderation comes from one of those most radical and reactionary groups in the country should be cause for concern and suspicion. While Mosley and his followers claim otherwise and have denounced these rumors as 'establishment-borne conspiracy theories', many on the left have attempted to alarm the people of Britain of Mosley’s true intentions, with PSPB spokesman Tony Benn comparing Mosley’s supposed ambitions to that of the infamous republican dictator Oliver Cromwell."
